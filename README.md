Developed a real-time chat web application enabling instant communication between users using Socket.io for real-time messaging. Built the backend with Node.js and REST APIs to handle user authentication, message management, and server-side logic, while MongoDB was used for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Designed a responsive and interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing smooth real-time message updates without page refresh. Implemented features such as user login, live chat rooms, message broadcasting, and real-time notifications.

Focused on event-driven architecture, real-time communication, and full-stack development concepts. This project strengthened skills in backend development, database integration, and building scalable real-time web applications.
